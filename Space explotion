Many people think that the government should spend money to space explotion, while other think that it is a waste of $. Dicussion___

Some people argue that the government allocate financial resource to space research, other, however, it is a waste of public money. This essay will examine both views and explain why I lean forward the latter.

On the one hand, there are some reasons why people think that political leaders allocate money to space explotion.
The first reason is that they find definitive traces of life in hablitable planets. Currently, the Earth facing the rapid exhausion of natural resource and extreme weather events.
These destroy ecosystem, enviroment and prevent growth of life from the surface.
Therefore, many people believe that the government should spend public money on space explotion to look for exoplanets where becoming second home to people.
Another reason is that they need this explotion to disable medicine. Scientist can based on chemical compound which receive from space mission to discover a cure incrable diseases, such as HIV, cancer

On the other hand, I side with those who believe that it not worth investing money in space project. First, space research requires a huge amount of money without any __ of success.
It costs multi billion dollar to design and build spacecrafts, but with a very small technical error it can explode within seconds of take off.
This means that the huge amount of money just goes to waste.
This is particularty the case for astronaut who join in Apollo mission of NASA from 1960 to 1972
